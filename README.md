# Social Network Project 

This is a âœ¨**spare-time project**âœ¨ that I'm working on when time allows. It is still under development and will be updated gradually over time.

The goal is to build a full-stack social network application using:

- React (frontend)
- Node.js + Express (backend)
- MySQL (database)

## ðŸš€ How to Run the Project

You will need:

- Node.js + npm
- MySQL
- (Optional) Postman or similar tool for API testing

Then:
cd .\front_end\
npm install
npm start

And:
cd .\back_end\
npm install
npm start

**RUN THEM SIMULTANEOUSLY!!!**
