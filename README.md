Social Network Project
This is a âœ¨**hobby project**âœ¨ that I'm working on whenever time allows. It's still in development and will be incrementally updated over time.

The plan is to build a full-stack social network application with:

React (frontend)
Node.js + Express (backend)
MySQL (database)
ðŸš€ How to Run the Project
You'll need:

Node.js + npm
MySQL
(Optional) Postman or equivalent tool for testing APIs
Then run two terminals, in one:
cd.\\front_end
npm install npm start

And in other:
cd.\\back_end
npm install
npm start

**RUN THEM BOTH AT THE SAME TIME!!!**

There is SQL file named **react** in the repository which you can use for table structure.
